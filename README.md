The Homebound Ease website was created to support homebound individuals, enabling them to search, compare, and select the most affordable registered service providers. 
Developed with input from dialysis center patients, its design prioritizes accessibility for disabled users. The website has received positive feedback during testing and 
will be officially launched once a secure system is in place to verify service providers and ensure authenticity.
